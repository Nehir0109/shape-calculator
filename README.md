# Shape Calculator üìêüî¢

## Introduction
Welcome to the Shape Calculator documentation! This web application allows users to calculate areas and perimeters (or other relevant properties) of various geometric shapes, including rectangles, squares, circles, and triangles. The results are dynamically displayed, providing a user-friendly experience for shape calculations.

## Files

index.html: Defines the structure of the main page with navigation buttons to select different shapes.

rectangle.html: Provides the layout and functionality for calculating rectangle area and perimeter.

square.html: Provides the layout and functionality for calculating square area and perimeter.

circle.html: Provides the layout and functionality for calculating circle area and circumference.

triangle.html: Provides the layout and functionality for calculating triangle area.

styles.css: Contains the styling for the HTML elements across all pages, including layout and visual appearance.

index.js: Implements the JavaScript logic for shape calculations and form interactions. Handles calculations for rectangle, square, circle, and triangle, and manages form input behavior.

## Usage

### To use the Shape Calculator:

Open the Main Page: Go to https://nehir-shape-calculator.netlify.app/ in your web browser to select a shape for calculation.

Select a Shape: Click on one of the buttons (Rectangle, Square, Circle, Triangle) to navigate to the respective shape‚Äôs calculation page.

Enter the Values: Input the necessary values for the selected shape (length and width for rectangles, side length for squares, radius for circles, and base and height for triangles).

Calculate: Press the "Calculate" button or simply press Enter to perform the calculation and view the results.

## Functionality

### Dynamic Calculations

Rectangle: Calculates area and perimeter based on the length and width provided.

Square: Calculates area and perimeter based on the side length provided.

Circle: Calculates area and circumference based on the radius provided.

Triangle: Calculates area based on the base and height provided.

### Input Handling

Enter Key Support: Users can press Enter while focusing on input fields to trigger the calculation, making the application more interactive and responsive.

Error Handling: If invalid or empty input is provided, an error message will be displayed, and the form will prompt for correct input.

### Visuals

Each shape‚Äôs page displays a relevant image (e.g., Rectangle, Square, Circle, Triangle) for better visualization.

Results are displayed dynamically below the input fields, with clear error messages if necessary.

## Conclusion
The Shape Calculator provides a simple and interactive way to perform geometric calculations for various shapes.
